              <h3>Relaxed hair</h3>
              <p className=''>
                Our stylists are technically trained to understand the science
                of hair and the structural changes a relaxer can have on the
                hair. With this knowledge we can skilfully handle your relaxed
                hair in a way that minimises breakage and retains fullness of
                the hair. We offer services such as conditioning moisture and
                protein treatments, relaxers, texlax, and general hair
                maintenance for chemically processed hair.

                Our lace closures and lace frontals are made using high quality
                thin lace making them almost undetectable. They are hand knotted
                to give the illusion of a natural hairline. We also customise
                them and tint the lace to ensure that it blends perfectly with
                the clients skin tone.
