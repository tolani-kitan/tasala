                      Say it with me: Having curly hair is an honor and
                      privilege. Then, repeat it one more time. Solange, who so
                      eloquently reminded us that our curls are our crown with
                      her heartfelt lyrics featured in 2016 single "Don't Touch
                      My Hair", further reaffirmed that we should be proud to
                      treat our hair like royalty.

                      I think that the most important thing a woman can have-
                      next to talent, of course- is her hairdresser.

                      Look, I love the feeling of a shower-fresh, squeaky clean
                      scalp as much as the next person, but most days, I end up
                      throwing my hair in a messy bun on top of my head during
                      my daily shower. The extra effort of getting my hair wet,
                      shampooing twice, waiting for it to towel dry, then blow
                      drying it into submission just seems far too daunting when
                      I don't plan on leaving the house.
